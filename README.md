Something that every movie lover should have on their cell phone: an app that highlights popular, now playing, top rated and upcoming movies.

This app uses the TMDb API to display the movies.

# Architectural Design Pattern
In this project the MVVM architecture was used along with the Clean Architecture. This choice was made because MVVM + Clean Architecture makes it easier to test, makes the code even more decoupled and makes the project easier to maintain.

# Android Architecture Components
Some components of the Android Architecture Components library collection were also used in this project, such as:
- Room
- LiveData
- ViewModel
- Lifecycle-aware components
- ViewBinding
- Navigation

# Other libraries
- Koin
- Glide
- Retrofit
- Gson
- OkHttp3
- Coroutines
- Firebase (app distribution, crashlytics and performance)
